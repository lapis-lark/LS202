    <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my website! It's for practicing <strong>HTML</strong>, and you <em>just gotta</em> practice if you want to build sites with ease!
    </p>
    <p class = 'more-content'>
      There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing
      around with HTML &amp; CSS. When I'm done, these last two
      paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the "class" attribute
      on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.
    </p>
    <p class="more-content" id="last-paragraph">
      Last paragraph!
